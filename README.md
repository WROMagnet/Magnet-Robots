## Summary of our project
- We started by building a robot made from parts from one of the Pitsco Tetrix kits, which is no longer the robot we are using today. The previous robot was made of metal and complied very exactly with the maximum measurements indicated in the rules. 

[Previous robot process](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/tree/main/Previous%20vehice%20process).

- But after the pre-World Cup in Puerto Rico, our team decided to create a new robot that was lighter, smaller and easier to transport. So when we started our project, we started looking around our workshop at school and we found a kit called CVpro which was a robot that was disassembled and was basically a robot that was controlled through a cell phone. But we took advantage of several of its parts to be able to start assembling our new robot. And so we begin the base mount of the robot. 

[Day one of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/100)

[Day two of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/102)

[Day three of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/103)

- After we assembled the base robot we started modifying it to make it look good and most importantly to make the robot work.

[Modifications](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/104)

- After we made all the modifications we programmed it mainly for the smooth track.And we put him on the track to run.

[Video of the vehicle on the track](https://youtu.be/ARrVYiQlyKw?si=BYaJd71k7EOW9tmP)

- The program we used was the official Arduino app ["Arduino DEL"](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=9efa54b30625e1f45f48d1535274e3f1181cd6e31c043c6980ad2a2e53aceb8cJmltdHM9MTczMTI4MzIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=1418bfa8-b117-6a14-2d29-abc9b0876b5e&psq=arduino+DEL&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJkdWluby5jYy9lbi9zb2Z0d2FyZQ&ntb=1)

- For the obstacle course we have mixed lego spike with arduino so to program the lego spike we have used block programming and the program we use to program the [lego spike](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=74fa6ae522d1ece837d01362ed0b58f378fc8642357f599fcba9f03a8ab3e9f4JmltdHM9MTczMTI4MzIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=1418bfa8-b117-6a14-2d29-abc9b0876b5e&psq=descargar+lego+spike&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lZHVjYXRpb24ubGVnby5jb20vZXMtZXMvZG93bmxvYWRzL3NwaWtlLWFwcC9zb2Z0d2FyZS8&ntb=1)

# WHAT IS THIS CATEGORY ABOUT?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966107c3-231e-46d2-bc14-70191379d4fa)

***

- This is the track for this category in 2024, on this track there are 2 modes, free mode and obstacle mode. In free mode only the robot will have to make 3 laps and stop after completing the 3 laps. In obstacle mode the robot has to make 3 laps while avoiding the obstacles and after making 3 laps it will have to parallel park.

- The obstacles are placed by the Judge and he is the one who assigns the parking spot. Both the obstacles and the parking spot are at the discretion of the Judge, so it is completely random.

- If the robot hits a wall the Judge stops counting the time and when he indicates the robot can be picked up.

- The walls in the center of the court can vary in size.

#### This category may be similar to autonomous robots that are sent into space to explore planets, since they must avoid any object that gets in their way and also explore and send information about the planet.

- WRO provides us with the [official rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17180985/WRO-2024-Future-Engineers-Self-Driving-Cars-General-Rules.pdf) for this category of Future Engineers.

  # Explanation of the free track programming

  ## 1. Libraries and Object Creation
- `Servo.h` library is included to control a servo motor.
- `miServo` is a `Servo` object to control the direction of the robot by adjusting the servo motor's angle.

  ## 2. Pin Assignments
- ### Motor Control Pins:
- `motorA` controls the motor direction.
- `velocidadA` is used for speed control.
- `frenoA` controls the brake for the motor.

- ### Ultrasonic Sensor Pins:
- `trigPin1` and `echoPin1` control ultrasonic sensor 1.
-`trigPin2` and `echoPin2` control ultrasonic sensor 2.

- ### Distance and Time Limits:
- `distanciaMax` and `distanciaMin` define maximum and minimum distances in centimeters to decide when the robot should avoid an obstacle.
- `tiempoLimite` defines a time limit of 57 seconds after which the robot stops.

- ### Time Variable:
- `tiempoInicio` is used to store the programâ€™s start time to compare against `tiempoLimite`.

## 3. Distance Measurement Function
- `medirDistancia` function sends a trigger pulse on the ultrasonic sensor and waits for an echo. It calculates the distance based on the time taken for the echo to return.

 ## 4. Setup Function
- Configures motor and sensor pins.
- Initializes `Serial` for monitoring, attaches the servo to pin 5, and stores the start time.

 ## 5. Main Loop
- ### Time Check:
- If `tiempoLimite` (57 seconds) has passed, the program stops the motor and servo and enters an infinite loop.

### Distance Measurement:
- The robot checks distances from both ultrasonic sensors and prints these to the Serial Monitor.

### Obstacle Avoidance Logic:
- For both sensors, if `distancia1` or `distancia2` is greater than `distanciaMax`, the robot moves forward at an angle (servo set to 134 or 104).
- If the distance is below `distanciaMin`, the robot makes a sharper turn to avoid the obstacle.
- If the distance is between `distanciaMin` and `distanciaMax`, the servo is set to a neutral position, allowing the robot to move straight.

### Delay:
- A 100-millisecond delay is added at the end of the loop for stability, balancing detection speed and response rate.
