## Summary of our project
- #### We started by building a robot made from parts from one of the Pitsco Tetrix kits, which is no longer the robot we are using today. The previous robot was made of metal and complied very exactly with the maximum measurements indicated in the rules. 

[Previous robot process](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/tree/main/Previous%20vehice%20process).

- But after the pre-World Cup in Puerto Rico, our team decided to create a new robot that was lighter, smaller and easier to transport. So when we started our project, we started looking around our workshop at school and we found a kit called CVpro which was a robot that was disassembled and was basically a robot that was controlled through a cell phone. But we took advantage of several of its parts to be able to start assembling our new robot. And so we begin the base mount of the robot. 

[Day one of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/100)

[Day two of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/102)

[Day three of our current robot build](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/103)

- After we assembled the base robot we started modifying it to make it look good and most importantly to make the robot work.

[Modifications](https://github.com/WROMagnet/Magnet-Robots/issues/104)

- After we made all the modifications we programmed it mainly for the smooth track.And we put him on the track to run.

- The program we used was the official Arduino app ["Arduino DEL"](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=9efa54b30625e1f45f48d1535274e3f1181cd6e31c043c6980ad2a2e53aceb8cJmltdHM9MTczMTI4MzIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=1418bfa8-b117-6a14-2d29-abc9b0876b5e&psq=arduino+DEL&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJkdWluby5jYy9lbi9zb2Z0d2FyZQ&ntb=1)

# WHAT IS THIS CATEGORY ABOUT?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966107c3-231e-46d2-bc14-70191379d4fa)

***

- This is the track for this category in 2024, on this track there are 2 modes, free mode and obstacle mode. In free mode only the robot will have to make 3 laps and stop after completing the 3 laps. In obstacle mode the robot has to make 3 laps while avoiding the obstacles and after making 3 laps it will have to parallel park.

- The obstacles are placed by the Judge and he is the one who assigns the parking spot. Both the obstacles and the parking spot are at the discretion of the Judge, so it is completely random.

- If the robot hits a wall the Judge stops counting the time and when he indicates the robot can be picked up.

- The walls in the center of the court can vary in size.

#### This category may be similar to autonomous robots that are sent into space to explore planets, since they must avoid any object that gets in their way and also explore and send information about the planet.

- WRO provides us with the [official rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17180985/WRO-2024-Future-Engineers-Self-Driving-Cars-General-Rules.pdf) for this category of Future Engineers.
