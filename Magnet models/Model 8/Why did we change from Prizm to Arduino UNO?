We changed the controller because we changed the robot in many ways and we noticed that the robot had a lot of weight.
So we changed to Arduino Uno because it is light and we could replicate what the Prizm did with the Arduino UNOs. And if it were possible to program it,
the sensor would also be easier by using an Arduino as a bridge for the color sensor and the Prizm because the reaction was slow and not effective.
And so with the Arduinos directly the response would be fast.
