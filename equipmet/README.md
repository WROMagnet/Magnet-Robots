- ### This folder contains the components we have used in our current robot. It has photos of the components used.

- #### We use a 180 degree servo motor to make the front tire turns. This is the servo we have used.

- #### As a controller we use an arduino mega.

- #### In order to use the Arduino Mega properly, we have installed 2 adapters. One is a module for controlling the DC motor, the other is an extension of an Arduino Uno that is also compatible with the Arduino Mega. We installed it to have more 5V and Grw ports to be able to power all the sensors used.

- #### The DC motor we used was this one for the rear wheel drive since the competition rules prohibit us from having two motors to control each individual tire, so we have this motor that can control two tires at the same time because it has two axles.

- #### In our current robot we use 3 ultrasonic sensors to detect walls and stay away from them.![ultrasonic sensors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7181325-7033-4a16-a017-a6b810739cf2)
